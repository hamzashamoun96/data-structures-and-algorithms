1) push method : to add a new node to the top of the stack.
2) pop method : removes the top node.
3) peak method : returning the top node value. 
4) isEmpty method : return a boolean if the stack is empty or not.
1) enqueue method : to add a new node to the end of the queue.
2) dequeue method : removes the front node.
3) peak method : returning the front node value. 
4) isEmpty method : return a boolean if the queue is empty or not.

## Test 
* To test it in the terminal run the command npm test stacks-and-queues.
